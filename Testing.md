## Validation

### W3 HTML
I validated the HTML with [W3 Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/). The results can be seen below;
 - [index]()
 - [avengers]()

 **Warnings**
    

### W3 CSS 
I validated the CSS with the [w3 Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and it found no errors.
 - [CSS validation]()

### JavaScript 
I validated the JavaScript with [JSHint](https://jshint.com/).
 - [script.js]()
 - [modals.js]()
 - [audio.js]()
 
 All three tests showed inaccurate issues with undefined and unused variables, as the variables are used in the other JavaScript files.

### Google Lighthouse Audit
I used Google's lighthouse audit to test the website conforms positively with Google's performance metrics, intending to achieve scores of 90% in all areas on desktop.

## Responsive Device & Browser Testing
To test the responsiveness of the site I used [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools), [Responsive Design Checker](https://www.responsivedesignchecker.com/) and [Lambdatest](https://www.lambdatest.com/).

### Responsiveness
![Desktop Responsiveness]()

![Mobile Responsiveness]()

To ensure responsive I used bootstrap, flexbox methods and containers to ensure all site pages resized responsively for all device viewports.

### Browser Compatibility
