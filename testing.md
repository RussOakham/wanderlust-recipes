## Validation

### W3 HTML

I validated the HTML with [W3 Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/). The results can be seen below;

* [index](testing.md)
* [avengers](testing.md)

  **Warnings**

### W3 CSS

I validated the CSS with the [w3 Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and it found no errors.

* [CSS validation](testing.md)

### JavaScript

I validated the JavaScript with [JSHint](https://jshint.com/).

* [script.js](testing.md)
* [modals.js](testing.md)
* [audio.js](testing.md)

  All three tests showed inaccurate issues with undefined and unused variables, as the variables are used in the other JavaScript files.

### Google Lighthouse Audit

I used Google's lighthouse audit to test the website conforms positively with Google's performance metrics, intending to achieve scores of 90% in all areas on desktop.

## Responsive Device & Browser Testing

To test the responsiveness of the site I used [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools), [Responsive Design Checker](https://www.responsivedesignchecker.com/) and [Lambdatest](https://www.lambdatest.com/).

### Responsiveness

To ensure responsive I used bootstrap, flexbox methods and containers to ensure all site pages resized responsively for all device viewports.

### Browser Compatibility

## Testing User Stories

## Issues I had to overcome
